/*
  server.js - server-side code intentionally removed.

  This project has been converted to a static-only frontend using
  in-browser persistence (localStorage). The original server implementation
  used Express, multer, and a database. Those files are retained in the
  repository as commented references, but the runtime code has been removed
  to prevent accidental execution in serverless/static environments.

  If you later want to re-enable the backend, restore the original files
  from version control history or contact the maintainer.
